# How this works
npm run deploy


# More info about how this works.
Develop in the main branch
install the gh-pages package:     npm install gh-pages --save-dev
Deploy running "npm run deploy" command   --> This will only work if the vscode git is well connected to github.
In github pages put deploy from branch and select the gh-page branch
Npm run deploy takes the create-react-app project and makes it js and puts it in the gh-pages branch. It will automatically deploy in github. You can watch the process of deploying in the github actions page of the project repo. You need to configure the page in github for publishing.

# Another way of running
make the npm run deploy command directly from github desktop terminal.
