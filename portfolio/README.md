# More info about how this works.
Develop in the main branch
Deploy running "npm run deploy" command

For deploy to work you need to have nodejs and make npm install in the main branch inside portfolio. Once that's setted up, the npm run deploy will work.
Npm run deploy takes the create-react-app project and makes it js and puts it in the gh-pages branch. It will automatically deploy in github. You can watch the process of deploying in the github actions page of the project repo. You need to configure the page in github for publishing.
